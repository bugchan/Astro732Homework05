\section{Acceptance/Rejection \\Method}
The Acceptance-Rejection Method is a way to draw random deviates from a density function, $p(x)$. The steps are the following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Choose a function $f(x) > p(x)$ for all $x$ and make sure it is an integrable function.
    \item Calculate the total area of $f(x)$ and draw a uniform random deviate,$y \in [0,A_T]$.
    \item Evaluate the inverse function $f^{-1}(x)=F(y)$ to find $x_0$.
    \item Draw a second uniform random deviate, $f_1 \in[0,f(x_0)]$.
    \item Evaluate the density function $p(x_0)=p_1$ and if $f_1\leq p_1$, accept $x_0$ as a random deviate of the density function $p(x)$. Otherwise, reject the value and start process again.
\end{enumerate}

The set of accepted $x_0$ will map the density function $p(x)$. 


For this problem, we define p(x) to be 


% Use the Acceptance-Rejection Method to
% draw random deviates from a probability distribution shaped like the first half-cycle of a sine
% function (properly normalized) on the interval $[0,\pi]$.I would like you to use two different
% functions for $f(x)$:
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item a constant $f(x)$ for the full interval
%     \item any other non-constant function of your choice.
% \end{enumerate}

% In each case you should compare the sine wave to a histogram your random deviates to show
% that you have faithfully sampled from the distribution. Finally, for each case show that the
% inefficiency factor (the number of trials you have to make divided by the number of good deviates
% that you get) is equal to the area under $f(x)$ on the interval $[0,\pi]$. Note that the function that
% you choose must have an efficiency factor that is smaller than that of the constant function.
