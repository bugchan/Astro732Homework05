\section{Acceptance/Rejection \\Method}

Use the Acceptance-Rejection Method to
draw random deviates from a probability distribution shaped like the first half-cycle of a sine
function (properly normalized) on the interval $[0,\pi]$.I would like you to use two different
functions for $f(x)$:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item a constant $f(x)$ for the full interval
    \item any other non-constant function of your choice.
\end{enumerate}

In each case you should compare the sine wave to a histogram your random deviates to show
that you have faithfully sampled from the distribution. Finally, for each case show that the
inefficiency factor (the number of trials you have to make divided by the number of good deviates
that you get) is equal to the area under $f(x)$ on the interval $[0,\pi]$. Note that the function that
you choose must have an efficiency factor that is smaller than that of the constant function.
